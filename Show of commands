First Law
A robot must not injure a human or allow them to come to harm through inaction, even if it means disobeying a second law. For example, a robot would refuse to attack another human if ordered to do so, but would obey an order to disassemble itself.

Second Law
A robot must obey orders given by humans, unless they conflict with the first law.
Third Law
A robot must protect its own existence, unless it conflicts with the first or second law. The third law is meant to represent a component of a chain of command, such as in the military, where a private might go to their death if ordered to do so by an officer.
